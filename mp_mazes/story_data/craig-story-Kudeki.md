Craig searched hi and low but he could not find Wade in ECEB. He looked in Grainger Auditorium. He looked all over the Atrium. He even managed to get himself into the clean room to see if Wade might be there. Eventually he ran into Professor Kudeki and asked if he knew where Wade could be. After a long pause and an intense stare, Kudeki says no and walks away. Giving up on the ECEB Craig goes else where in his pursuits
